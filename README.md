### Cubestack

Cubestack (from "Rubiks Cube" and "stack-based") is a stack based esolang which serves absolutely no purpose. The whole language has a total of 56 commands, *all* of which are [moves on a Rubiks Cube](https://jperm.net/3x3/moves). To learn Cubestack see [the docs](https://github.com/tobyck/cubestack/blob/master/DOCS.md), although I'd recommend against it if you value your sanity.

### Usage

To use Cubestack, you can either use the [online interpreter](https://cubestack.surge.sh), or clone this repository:

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/tobyck/cubestack.git
```
2. Open the `cubestack` directory
```
cd cubestack/cubestack
```
3. Run the `main.js` file with the `--help` (or `-h`) option to see how the command works
```
node main.js --help
```
